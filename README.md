The acrylic Bolt is a project that LAZYDESIGNER started in May 2020. 
The goal is to try ergo like layout with arrow keys. 
Historic version:
* The first version is a prototype kit sharing with some friends.
* The second version has been on sale in Auguest 2020. The layout has been adjusted. The PCB is yellow and with hotswap socket. The kit uses stainless steel plate and a piece of stainless steel as a weight. 30 kits are made in total for that version.
* After that, some users requested solder PCB, and hoped for lower price. So the third version has been made. The PCB needs solder and no RGB leds by default. The kit uses aluminum plate but still keep the stainless steel weight.
All sets of CAD file of Bolt was on the website lazydesigners.cn and 

About the design of Bolt:
* It's solely designed by LAZYDESIGNERS from scratch. 
* Not a single Alice keyboard file has been used when designing Bolt. So It's not related to any Alice keyboard versions. 
* It's using Atmega32U4 AU MCU, with 13 RGB Leds intoal, 9 for underglow, 4 for logo lighting. (Optional on solder version)
* All Bolt kits have metal plate and stainless steel bottoms as weights to make the acrylic kits more practical to function as daily keyboards.
