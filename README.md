# Bolt
Acrylic layer case file for Bolt - A 40% ergo qmk keyboard

The acrylic Bolt is a project that LAZYDESIGNER started in May 2020. The goal is to try ergo like layout. 
Historic version:
* The first version is a prototype kit sharing with some friends.
* The second version has been on sale in Auguest 2020. The layout has been adjusted. The PCB is yellow and with hotswap socket. The kit uses stainless steel plate and a piece of stainless steel as a weight. 30 kits are made in total for that version.
* After that, some users requested solder PCB, and hoped for lower price. So the third version has been made. The PCB needs solder and no RGB leds by default. The kit uses aluminum plate but still keep the stainless steel weight.
 
About the design of Bolt:
* It's solely designed by LAZYDESIGNERS.  
* Not a single Alice keyboard file has been used when designing Bolt. So It's not related to any Alice keyboard versions.
* It's using Atmega32U4 AU MCU, with 13 RGB Leds intoal, 9 for underglow, 4 for logo lighting.
