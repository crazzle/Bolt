The acrylic Bolt is a project that LAZYDESIGNER started in May 2020. 
The goal is to try ergo like layout with arrow keys.  
Historic version:
* The first version is a prototype kit sharing with some friends.
* The second version has been on sale in Auguest 2020. The layout has been adjusted. The PCB is yellow and with hotswap socket. The kit uses stainless steel plate and a piece of stainless steel as a weight. 30 kits are made in total for that version.
* After that, some users requested solder PCB, and hoped for lower price. So the third version has been made. The PCB needs solder and no RGB leds by default. The kit uses anodized aluminum plate to add compatiblity to more switches but still keep the stainless steel weight. 50 kits were made in total.

All sets of CAD file of Bolt was open on the website lazydesigners.cn for users to customize. After Bolt clones were made by some ppl，and those clone users turned to us for customer service, we pulled off those files. 

亚克力Bolt是LAZYDESIGNERS于2020年5月正式完成设计并开始制作的一款套件。目的是为了测试ergo形态并具备方向键的40配列是否具有可用性。  
历史版本：
* 第一个版本是与朋友分享的测试原型。
* 第二个版本是正式出售版本。修改了配列，PCB是黄色阻焊，热插拔。定位板是镜面不锈钢并有一块不锈钢底板作为配重。 一共出货30套。
* 之后有些用户要求焊接定位板并希望进一步降低售价，所以第三个版本修改为黑色阻焊的焊接PCB，并默认不带RGB灯珠。定位板为了增加更多轴的适应性改为阳极铝，并保留了不锈钢板作为配重。一共50套。 

为了方便用户定制更换，我们将全套图纸开放在我们的网站lazydesigners.cn上。当我们发现有些用户购买了使用我们图纸仿制并声称是Bolt的产品，并在不知情的情况下向我们寻求售后之后，我们从网站上撤下了图纸。  

About the design of Bolt:
* It's solely designed by LAZYDESIGNERS from scratch. 
* Not a single Alice keyboard file has been used when designing Bolt. So It's not related to any Alice keyboard versions. 
* It's using Atmega32U4 AU MCU, with 13 RGB Leds in total, 9 for underglow, 4 for logo lighting. (Optional on solder version)
* All Bolt kits have metal plate and stainless steel bottoms as weights to make the acrylic kits more practical to function as daily keyboards.

关于亚克力Bolt的设计：
* 所有设计由LAZYDESIGNERS自主单独完成。
* 没有使用任何Alice的开源图纸，所以Bolt跟Alice任何版本之间并无关联。
* 使用 Atmega32U4 AU作为主控，一共13颗RGB灯珠，9颗作为底灯，4颗logo灯。（焊接版本为可选）
* 所有Bolt套件都具备金属定位板和不锈钢配重以保证日常使用下有比较好的打字体验。

图纸使用指南  
Acrylic layers:
| No | Layer | Standard thickness |
| :----:|  :----: | :----: |
| 1 | Top layer | 5mm |
| 2 | Second layer | 3mm |
| 3 | Port layer | 5mm |
| 4 | Support layer | 5mm |
| 5 | Bottom layer | 3mm |
| 6 | Two feet layers | 5mm |  

* All those layers are mirrored in the dwg file, which means you are actually looking them from the bottom. It will have a better surface of each layer after laser cut.
* In some area, the standard thickness is different to the actual thickness of acrylic layer. In China, 5mm thickness moudling acrylic plate has an actual thickness between 4.5-4.8mm. 3mm thickness moudling acrylic plate has an actual thickness between 2.7-2.8mm.
* The top layer and the second layer are above the plate. The total height will add to 7.2mm, which just cover the lowest edge of some profile keycaps. 3X3mm could also be used if you want to fully cover the keycaps.
* Port layer is the key part of
